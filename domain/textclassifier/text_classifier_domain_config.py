    Implementation of the DomainConfig class for the textclassifier domain, the
    domain's chance to tell the system about different aspects of data-driven
    configuration.

    A 'DomainConfig' instance for ENN describes the data that's required
    for training and evaluation, including where it is, and how to load it
    and use it.

    Also, a chance is afforded by this class to translate some domain-specific
    parameters into parameters that the service-side NetworkBuilder would
    need to know.

    Each instance is intended to be stateless, and thus no constructor
    is necessary.
