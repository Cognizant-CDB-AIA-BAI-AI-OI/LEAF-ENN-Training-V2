0	  :: This is now very concerning. I emailed Elonka last night about my scepticism as to the real identity of these posts. My suspicions arose when I received an email from (a) Lord Knowle to help edit the Knights Templar article. Looking back on it later it did seem diferent from the usual style that I would normally get from the person that I know who owns this account. I was very puzzled over the temperament and writing style of the edits on the Knights Templar page. The attacks on the Earl of Bradford seem very similar, someone who has also been attacked for their campaign against pseudo-Templar websites. LK is also very private about his involvement and doesn't participate on public forums on this subject. If he had wanted to do so, then he would have done so a lot earlier in the article's lifecycle than these last few weeks. Having spent a good few hours going through all his edits there is even one that was posted when I was speaking to him on his mobile. I have checked the date and time entry and on that day he was in Suffolk, over 200 miles away from his home. I would urgently request that LK's account is locked until this is checked out. I have emailed him and await his reposnse.	dev

0	"  == Background section ==  At the present time, the ""background"" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to ""take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""  The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.  If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.  The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as ""a homemade clock"" or ""an invention"".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went ""viral"", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.  Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

Of course I would not include this in any article (and defintely not this one) without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research, I note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country. :::::*What is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of 'hits' for rooster found in NZ media. Many of these hits will be refering to the Australian league club Sydney Roosters and not the poultry. Clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the country's readership than poultry. :::::*Just stating both 'Cockerel' and 'Rooster' are used is factual, whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data, and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject. :::::*Also, I can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both 'Cockerel' or 'Rooster' are common.	train

I take this exercise as an opportunity to apply other edits to the article too, if it grabs my fancy.  So in this example (The Grapes of Wrath (film)) the simple solution would be just to do what the error message tells you.  But the longer solution, and probably what the original author wanted, is to remove the group name from the .  I'm also keen on articles having proper citations, which aren't dead, so I often try to clean the citations too.

0	"  == Original author and valid reference ==  Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.       The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida. The answer is Yes! For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures. And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?  According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.  Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word ""consensus"", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.  Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text, see below!!   * Wallin H. 2008, 129 p: An investigation of friction graphs ranking ability regarding the galling phenomenon in dry SOFS contact  (Adhesive material transfer and friction), A free pdf document available here or www.diva-portal.org found here or at www.uppsok.libris.kb.se here use search words:""galling & Harald Wallin"" or the direct libris link here  I will reinstate my reference in the galling article and I may do so by the Wikipedia’s original means of existence and also formal rules of engagement    "	test

NKC = National Kennel Club  However, my research has proven that many other ""registries"" are also selling papers for Shiloh Shepherds!!  These include, but are not limited to .....  Other All-Breed Registries:   The following is a list of some of the other all-breed registries in existence in North America — Caution should be exercised when dealing with a breeder who registers with any of these registries, especially when the breed is recognized by any of the major all-breed registries listed above. Many breeders use these registries because they are not able to meet the more demanding requirements of the CKC, AKC, or UKC.   The information shown in quotations was taken directly from the registry's web site and speaks for itself as to the goals of some of these registries.    American Canine Association (ACA) — ""America's largest veterinary health tracking purebred canine registry."" — Note: In the ""Find A Puppy"" section of their website, dog/puppy seekers are referred to pet/retail stores. Very little information is available on the website regarding their goals or mission as a registry.   American Purebred Registry (APR) — The APR issues registration certificates for dogs and cats. They start a pedigree file with the information the owner sends them. Once APR accepts an application, a registration certificate is issued and the animal is considered registered. APR is a record keeping agency only and does not sponsor dog shows, field trials or competitions of any kind. On the application, the owner certifies that the dog or cat is a purebred representative of the breed. They take the owner's word for it and no proof is required.   America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) — ""An internationally recognized association of responsible pet owners, breeders, distributors, veterinarians, retailers, pet product manufacturers, and other concerned parties dedicated to the humane care of animals, the preservation of quality bloodlines, and the individual's right of pet ownership."" APRI recently re-incorporated as a for-profit corporation. — The APRI promotes and encourages the sale of dogs and cats through distributors and retailers. ""America's Pet Registry, Inc. was begun as insurance for the pet industry..."" ""APRI offers free dual registrations on dogs from reputable registration services to professional breeders. We classify a professional breeder as one who has three or more breeding females and who regularly sells puppies in the pet market.""   Animal Registry Unlimited (ARU) — Some statements found on the opening page of their website: ""We register all pets and animals."" ""We guarantee that your pet or animal can be registered with us."" ""Providing a registry for the development of new breeds of useful pets and animals. Unlike many organizations we encourage the development of new breeds.""   Continental Kennel Club (CKC) — Note: This registry is also known as the CKC and should not be confused with the Canadian Kennel Club — These are two completely separate registries.) — The Continental Kennel Club recognizes 450 breeds as purebred. The Continental Kennel Club has a section known as ""Miscellaneous Breed Registration"" which allows for the crossing of two purebred parents of different breed types to produce hybrid puppies. Registered as MISC/BREED1-BREED2 and isolated from purebred registrations, they are distinguished from other breeds on registration certificates by having ""non-purebred"" printed on their registration certificates. In addition, the Continental Kennel Club has a section within their club for developing new breeds. Stock used for these breeding programs is listed in the ""Development Class"". The Continental Kennel Club has implemented a classified section on their site where club members can advertise their breeds. If you have a look at some of the more popular breeds such as the Cocker Spaniel, some of the kennels advertising there include breeders of cock-a-poos and other crosses. The Continental Kennel Club's website provides very little information regarding their goals or mission as a registry.

0	Moving on from that, I too can see an issue with the age of Aldrasto's posts. As I stated previously, my speciality is Egypt, not Rome, but the same issue arises with Egyptian sources of the same era.  Basically, scholars from this period have great difficulty in perceiving, accommodating, or finding language with which to describe beliefs which are not found in Christianity.  Rather, scholars of the period -consciously or not - tend to describe by analogy with Christianity.  An absolute classic example is the translation of maa kherau as 'victorious''triumphant' or 'vindicated'. The words mean 'a true voice' and literally means that what one says will come about - but the underlying concept bears no relation whatsoever to the Christian concept of being saved from sin, having overcome Satan through faith in Christ. The Kemitic Egyptians had nothing that equates to the Christian belief in the need for salvation. The reason for the choice of words appears to be connected to Matthew 17, where Jesus drives out a demon that his disciples had been unable to exorcise, and tells them that with even a little faith they could command mountains to move about. A man who had passed the test of the judgement hall obtained power in Amentet, such that what he commanded to happen would happen, therefore according to the Christian model, this must be because he had in some way achieved the status of a Christian saint.    	train

Obama's wife Michelle during her studies at Princeton is famous works, which described two possible position on the Negro in American society: integrationist and segregacionistický. Integrationist means of the values of American (ie white, capitalist) society and may be a way to success. One can, however, it also in its look as a betrayal černošskosti.  His friends also include the radical pastor Jeremiah Wright. Among his ideas is the claim that HIV was deliberately invented by the U.S. government and used as a weapon against blacks and accused the U.S. government of plotting the attacks of September 11. [19] Wright is one of Obama's close friends, Obama met with him in the eighties .. Obama, Wright and his wife Michelle gave himself, as well as baptized their two daughters. Relations between him and the reverend married Obama's been warm. Barack Obama in 2008, however, distanced himself from Reverend Wright.  In the past, there were also some doubts about the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate [20].  Target of sharp criticism was his effort with the help of subsidies to promote both the industry and ecology, especially the production of cars with electric drive.

0	"  == Videology page deletion ==  Hi there. This is regarding the deletion of the Videology article I posted yesterday. The reason given was because there was ""no explanation of significance."" I was wondering if I could get more clarification.  According to A7 of the Criteria for Speedy Deletion article, an article must demonstrate why the subject is important or significant. It also states, ""The criterion does apply if the claim of significance or importance given is not credible."" In terms of credibility, it appears clear that the subject of the article has been covered by credible and reliable sources such as the New York Times and revered advertising and technology trade publications such as AdWeek and Tech Crunch.  As an aside, I'd be remiss to note that very similar advertising technologies currently have published Wikipedia articles, such as TubeMogul, YuMe and Adap.tv. Videology seems no less important in the advertising technology industry than these companies, especially when considering coverage in credible media sources as well as the amount of capital invested in Videology.  I'm very interested in discussing this further with you and completely amenable with any suggested ways to improve the article on the subject matter.  Thank you for your help, time and assistance.

0	128287604.0	  ::Hi Tom.  Funny one.  )  I don't see the """"note below"""" that you refer to.  As far as insertion of the info in the lead sentence, see the note above our conversation for my thoughts.  The Wiki policy that I refer to, which is the focus of some people who focus more on their view of required format than they do on what is AWK, no doubt largely causes this problem.  I expect you don't have a problem with mention that someone is Latvian, say, in the lead ... and do not view that as AWK.  And, as you and our colleague in the above discussion point out, it was seem non-AWK to say """"Jewish"""" or """"Jew"""" either before or after the reference to Latvian.  But, where some people's reading of the Wiki format direction stops us from doing this, we are necessarily forced into a more awkward presentation.  What you say """"looks, feels, very awkward.""""  If I want to satisfy the format-is-most-important people, and I want to satisfy the AWK-is-most-important people, and still wish to reflect simply, in the text, that someone is Jewish, with no greater emphasis than mention of the fact that they are Latvian, I find that at times this can be challenging (depending on whether the interested parties wish to make the article better, or just like deleting or reverting the info, without putting it in a form that works for them and others).  There are, I expect, one or two other groups of editors out there.  One group just wishes to delete mention of the fact generally that people are Jewish.  Another group wishes to delete mention of the fact that people are Jewish if they believe it will help  or hurt  the image of Jews that they wish to propogate.  These two group, I expect, do not indicate what their true interest is, but cloak their arguments with psuedo-rationale argumentation.  Personally, while I personally support reflection that people are Jewish especially in the area of sportspeople, I would not delete such a reference where the person in question is not one that the Jews might be proud to call their own.  If it notable, as measured  and this is important  by reflection of the fact in multiple sources that are reliable and not connected, then I have no problem with """"good"""" or """"bad"""" people being identified as Jews, if that is the case ... the same as I have no problem with them being identified as Latvians.  I appreciate your comment that you are not trying to ethnically cleanse articles, as you put it.  I just had some people delete a category that I created, Jewish figure skaters.  It was deleted despite the fact that attempts to delete Jewish sportspeople and Jewish fencers, with largely the same arguments, recently, by the same people, did not result in deletion.  That is now up for deletion review.  If you could give me any thoughts as to your thinking on how to address this issue that would be great as well.  Cheers.  Have a great weekend.   """	train

0	"  ==ISSO 1999-2001== This was an operation done with full knowledge of top levels of the USG Intelligence Community who monitored it. Several former Soviet-bloc physicists were brought in as consultants including Dr. Valdimir Poponin, allegedly a personal acquaintance of Gorbachev's. We were interested in evaluating the controversial claims of ""Russian torsion field weapons"" and, therefore brought Gennady Shipov over from Moscow several times. On one trip Shipov lived with Sarfatti for about 2 weeks. Richard Hammond, and American physicist from Fargo working on torsion fields for US Navy at one time was brought in as well as R. Kiehn a former scientist for US SAC and retired professor from University of Houston.  Shipov worked with Akimov in Moscow who allegedly had strong military connections in the Soviet era. Sarfatti was the senior theorist on the American side of the ISSO core staff that included Saul-Paul Sirag. He arranged for Creon Levit to be borrowed from NASA AMES to run the daily operations of the project. Over a million dollars was given to SARA, a TRW spinoff DOD contractor in Huntington, Beach CA to further test a system developed by Jim Corum. Corum also wrote papers on ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" and had entre to the Tesla Archive in Beograd even during the Cold War. This was unusual. Corum later went to ISR in W.Va, a think tank doing exotic work with USG funds provided by Senator Robert Byrd and his Congressional counter-part in his home district. The key objective, of course, was to try to figure out how the ""saucers"" really flew. All of the key scientists had interest in that, with the possible exception of Hammond and Kiehn. Harold Puthoff was brought in as a consultant. Ken Shoulders was also involved as were many others whose schemes were tested. The key foreign figure was Professor J. P. Vigier from Paris who had been Louis DeBroglie's assistant for decades. Sarfatti arranged for a Telegraph Hill Penthouse for Vigier to spend extended periods meeting the scientists flowing through ISSO. Vigier and Levit made a trip to Budapest in 2000 to meet with two Serbian physicists  Z.Maric  & A. Dragic who were experimentally testing an exotic atomic energy release idea of Vigier's of obvious interest to USG Intelligence because of its WMD implications. See the paper ""On the possible Existence of Tight Bound States in Quantum Mechanics"". pp 349-356 of the same volume of one of Sarfatti's papers, i.e. Vol 126 of Fundamental Theories of Physics, ISBN 1-4020-0885-6. This is not a coincidence. There are few coincidences in ""this Looking Glass War Twilight Zone interface between physics and politics"" to quote Sarfatti in one of his more eloquent moments. ;-) In fact, ISSO paid most of the expenses for the meeting upon which the volume is based. Enuff said. I hope this helps to somewhat clarify Sarfatti's multiple roles in these events. Sarfatt is a kind of a canary in the mind shaft for MASINT. For example, he was quite alarmed about an immanent attack on important US Military targets in the Fall of 2001. Sarfatti wrote numerous e-mails on this during July & Aug 2001. It seems to be a case of precognitive remote viewing. Unfortunately, Sarfatti was not able to pinpoint the exact time and place of the attack (attacks). He had guessed Oct 2001 because of some big anti-space weapons rally by leftist groups scheduled for that time at Lockheed-Martin. [User:UFO_Black_Ops]]  Oct 16, 2005"	dev

0	  :It is interesting to ponder where this transition occurs between a siphon that relies on cohesion and one that has only repulsion. To a first approximation, ignoring drag effects, if you take a siphon that is operating in vacuum and start lowering it into the atmosphere, the liquid in the tube above the lower reservoir will be in compression and without tension if its height above the surface of its reservoir is less than the barometric height at that ambient pressure. The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time! But as the barometric height exceeds the crest of the siphon, as is typical in practical siphons, there would be no more tension, and the chain model would no longer apply.   	test

0	"  == AI@50 ==  Thanks for the message on my Talk page.  No harm done, as I was offline of WP briefly at the time myself  and I learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to WP Notability standards, a lesson I've applied elsewhere.  I also learned more about the WP distinction between Primary and Secondary sources.  The result is all to the good. I'll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing, though I think on first sight that the template's terse wording  ""This article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past""   could be clearer as to its intent: does this really suffice to, in your words, ""let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason""?  I hope so, though it was not obvious to me: it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue.  If you can see it that way, as a relatively novice editor might, perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect, with some procedural directives and relevant links, to the original PROD and the policy guidelines for continuance.  I defer to your experience and good judgment.   BTW, since you liked Kurzweil's other book, The Singularity is Near is certainly worth a skim  Moore's Law on steroids  a fascinating perspective, from AI's greatest optimist.

In reality, however, it is almost always used to transliterate spoken Arabic, i.e. dialects, and there is an enormous amount of variation. For example, contrary to what the table suggests, both س and ص are usually represented by 's'; the distinction by using a capital 'S' for ص looks very neat, but I have never seen it in use. I would therefore suggest to provide more realistic examples, such as: (Lebanese) kif/keef sa7tak, chou/shu 3am ta3mil? weyn baddak nitghada? etc. Maybe it should also be noted that - in parallel with Arabic writing - there is a tendency to omit vowels.  	train

There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers).

Or perhaps not. Here's a tidbit from that last WS """"Trivia"""" section linked above:  * According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not """"stadium trained."""" (8th item down the list)  I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under """"Trivia"""" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later.   Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say """"Fall Classic Portal""""?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the """"Background"""" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.  Cutting to the chase: All this WS """"Trivia"""" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of """"labels"""" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.  Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits """"on the road"""" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said.   """	dev

The house of Tudor was descended (maternally) from a branch of the Lancasters, who did not survive the wars. The first Tudor King, Henry VII, came to the throne by winning the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, which was Tudor vs. York. The next year he married Elizabeth of York which helped legitimise his claim to the throne; but any tensions in the next few years were Tudor vs. York, not Tudor and York vs. ""Plantagenet assemblies."" :Research: I read the articles Plantagenet, Tudor dynasty, Battle of Bosworth, Henry VII of England, Elizabeth of York, checked the links  and a few on-line sources about Norton Canes, and off-line checked A.R.Myers, England in the Late Middle Ages, p.185, which lists risings and disturbances from 1486 to 1497 but does not mention this, and C.

I've no issue with you using IOC usage as the basis of a Manual of Style for various tables/articles etc, but in the places that specifically talk about the team name, or where the use of the BOA's own terminolology is relevant, but where you've been busily rewriting facts and removing sources you apparently just don't like, this is unnacceptable.

I've been visiting for several years, but it was nearly April 2011 that I started contributing seriously. Contributions on Commons Wikimedia.

0	"  == The best response is no response? ==  It seems that every time i try to talk to anybody around here, things end up deleted or changed. Chronic problem. At least this time it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change. Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems?  Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war zone.  What are you going to do about it? My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory, Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense. I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements.  LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.  Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are.  It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas.  Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama. People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is.  Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry and to the point message you failed to answer. - Wikipedia IS evil [23]  It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in ""neutral"" language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this ""Randian"" Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order.  Nice graphic box at the top of the page says to go post at the admin desk,.

I convinced videolover that the 1984 FBI warnings are orange, meaning that the 1984 FBI warnings are orange and the 1986 FBI warnings are red, which I also convinced him of.  4. I have seen the 1997 VHS of ""The Jungle Book"" before, there is no BV logo on there. Your seeing things. BTW, it is true that there are some copies that don't feature the green format logo on there, but it it also true that some copies actually had the green format logo. I have seen both those copies before, which both do not feature the BV logo.  5. A couple of my friends have ""Cool Runnings"", they have the previews I mentioned on there, it is real and a later printing, I thought that needed to be added on there.  6. I didn't know that ""The Sword in the Stone"" was sold in a black clamshell case, I thought it was sold in white because every case is in white. I could be wrong, but I say the version in black clamshell is the March 1986 edition, the one in white clamshell is from May 1986, the version that doesn't feature the trailer is from June 1986, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out October 1986, the version with a different tape label is from January 1987, and finally, the version where the cover doesn't have the VHS words means it came out February 1988.  7. I think the version where it has previews came out May 1986, the version with no previews and FBI warnings fading came out October 1986 because it was still in progression of editing, the version where the FBI warnings slideshow came out December 1986 because DSAS: vol.2 came out that day, meaning that version with the red FBI warnings and the VDA came out January 1987.

Earlier it was written Bihar is a north indian state but he changed it to east. I've some reliable source (like news clips from india's trusted media group like The hindu, India today, TOI for instance see , , , , , , ,  ) which openely says Bihar is a north indian state and also an Indian goverment site (Cultural zones of India) which puts Bihar in both the categories ie, North Central Indian Cultural Zone () and East Indian Cultural Zone () (this is the only source on which a wikipedia page North India is created). And that guy also has some proofs to put Bihar in east india (sources like same media group and bihar goverment sites and etc which says bihar an eastern indian state). So bro, i wanna say that isn't it possible to put and show Bihar as an eastern as well as northern Indian state likewise Indian goverment categorized it into these two groups?? I think it is possible because i've reliable source of information as reference for my claim and he also have so we both can put our points on wikipedia with our reference. And also, he always undo my edits when i put my claim, even i had a discussion with him but he seems to me like an arrogant and thinks that he's self sophisticated and self centred and like just he own these pages and only he could make edits and only his sources are reliable. Currently he's got that page blocked from editing with the help of some other users. So please you can do something about that? And also it feels to me and other peoples like denying our right to edit on wikipedia even when we've reliable source of information as to put as reference.

0	  I'm sorry I was an asshole about it.  The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.  This is just another little thing that distinguishes Aussie English from English English; that's all.   	train

Please see Wikipedia:Copy-paste.  :Secondly, Wikipedia articles are required to present a neutral point of view based on reliable secondary sources. Websites such as kalamullah.com are not considered reliable due to there polemic and sectarian nature. Neutral sources include media agencies such as the BBC or academic sources. Please read WP:RS. There are a number of academic sources on Ibn Qayyim such as the works of Livnat Holtzman and Jon Hoover which you should consider looking into that might provide reliable and accurate information about Zad al-Ma'ad.  :Thirdly, the language of the article needs to be Encyclopedic. Claims such as ""This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah.."" seems to be an example of puffery. Please read  WP:PUFF.  :Fourthly, adding statements such as ""Available from Australian Islamic Library website"" seems to be a clear case of WP:PROMOTION. Zad al-Ma'ad is available in a whole series of websites such as http://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single/en_Complete_Zaad_al_Maad.pdf, http://idci.co.uk/Provisions-For-The-Hereafter-Mukhtasar-Zad-Al-maad-699-d etc.... so there is no need to specify the Australian Islamic Library in particular.

Boxscores and writeups (such as Chicago Tribune, New York Times, and Sporting News) all agree on this undisputed fact.

0	" Surname: Podd This very unusual name is of English medieval origins, of which it has two, both quite separate. The first is a variant of the surname Pott. This is either a shortened form of the medieval given name Philpott, from the popular name Phillip, meaning ""lover of horses"", or is residential or locational, and describes a person who lived by a depression in the ground, or who came from a place such as Potcote in the county of Northamptonshire, or Potsgrove in Bedfordshire. The change in spelling from ""tt"" to ""dd"" is a common one and due to regional and dialectual differences as well as careless spelling. Another possible explanation is that it is a variant of Poad, a surname which means 'toad', and was a nickname surname for a person who was thought in someway to represent this animal. The church records of the Southwold Independent church in Suffolk records the baptism of James Pott in 1741 and of Elizabeth Podd in 1757. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Richard Pode. This was dated 1230, in the Pipe Rolls of Devonshire, during the reign of King Henry IIIrd of England, 1216 - 1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to ""develop"" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling."	test

0	"  == Fare Thee Weel, My Fine Friend! ==  I'm back in town for a day and thought I'd drop by again.  I took a look at how your RFAr was coming along, as well as your evidence you are marshalling in your ""Sandbox"" at [].  I must say I am rather disappointed at the slight nature of said evidence.  Not that I'm going to be around, but I'm sure you don't have a very strong hand, as it were.  As I've said before, I've already explained the alternate accounts, and users Casito (and Soltak also to a smaller extent) have been just as uncivil to me as I had been to them.  Casito basically accused me of being a pedophile/stalker of some kind in his statement to the Arbitration Committee after all.  One thing that did seriously concern me and that I'd like to, if you please, elucidate, is that Casito's statement about ""website defacement"" being a ""crime"" in ""many jurisdictions"" is absolutely 100% misleading in our context.  First, there are no local jurisdictional issues here, the Internet is regulated at the national level in the U.S.  (I'm sure you knew that).  Second, like I told Casito, this is a Wiki, any changes on here, no matter how malicious, do not rise to the level of ""defacement,"" which pertains more to secure/static websites (think US Govt homepages for instance).  I don't know whether he realised this, but in practical terms what Casito said was misleading on both legal and practical grounds, a bluff if you will.  Of course he didn't realise that I could see through his bluff, and when I calmly explained these two above points to him, he got really defensive and quite ""pissy,"" just as I'm sure he would in real life.  Just between you and me, he just doesn't seem like a really ""cool kid.""  For you, however, I have the utmost respect, being a liberal arts Professor in the only civilised part of the U.S. as far as I'm concerned.  However, you might want to hurry up presenting your evidence, since I'm once again leaving the country at 8:55 am tommorrow and won't be back until next month; and as I said on my user page, I won't be editing on Wikipedia any more after I get back to work and my routine, etc.  But take care, don't take any crap from those snotty preppy know-it-all kids you have up there (and how would I know about that hmmmmm????) )!!

Later, a Dyer supporter (Carson) attempted to pass a motion of mild approval of Dyer, but was defeated 230 MPs (against approval), 129 MPs (pro-mild approval).  This suggests that a majority of MPs was against Dyer.  All this is covered in the reference 4.

As it is, you have two different surveys about two different things and you cannot simply join up the results to show what you want to show.

0	"   I would support this as well.  Well-known examples/metaphors for AS would be quite useful to help illustrate to people what AS is like.  Each example would have to be explained, of course.  An obvious one would be Rain Man, from the movie ""Rain Man,"" who was character portrayed as having AS.  Ted Danson's character from the television series ""Becker"" might also fit here.   "	test

0	"  == Homeopathy ==  The reference to the term ""Homöopathie"" being first published in 1807 is on page 263 of the Dean article (page 9 of the pdf), although his referencing is a little convoluted - it cites an article called ""Fingerzeige auf den homöopathischen Gebrauch der Arzneien in der bisherigen Praxis"", referring to ref. 52 which itself refers back to ref. 24 which has it published in Hufeland’s Journal, xxvi (1807), 5–43.    I'll reword the ""Hahnemann's concept"" section to include Hahnemann's use of the term ""doctrine of specifics"" and reference Dudgeon.  I've noticed there's a short ""to do"" list on the Homeopathy talk page which I might try to work on now that things have quietened down over there.  Do you know of any good but reasonably concise sources (preferably available online) for:  *i) the concept of healing crisis in the context of homeopathy; *ii) the work of Constantine Hering and James Tyler Kent and how it differs from Hahnemann?  Wikipedia's Kent article cites your article ""Kent's Influence on British Homeopathy"" but any additional sources would be gratefully received.  All the best,    "	train
