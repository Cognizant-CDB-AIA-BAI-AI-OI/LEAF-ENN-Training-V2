# Session Server Tasks

session_server.py used to be quite monolithic.
Now the elements of the work that it does is broken out into
separate SessionTasks, where some tasks depend on others to get
their work done, and not all actually use the Session to talk to the service.

Here is an overview of the dependencies and descriptions of each.
Tasks described as Internal are not directly accessible via the
SessionServer command line interface

        AnalyzeResults      Takes results files generated by run and does
                            some analysis on them
